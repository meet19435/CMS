#                 Crime Management System

This project is developed to maintain the crime records data of a state. It involves all constituents of a nation's crime department as stakeholders.This database management system will allow the criminal record management employees to enter data, the police, the state and the investigators to check and analyse the data such as cases registered , active complaints, criminal's previous crime history and a citizen to check the status of their complaints or FIRs to monitor crime 24*7.

## Abstract

Safety and security of citizens is of primary importance to a country and ensuring overall security becomes all the more important in the present day, considering the crime rates are rising at alarming rates. Crime statistics serve as a vital tool for helping the criminal justice professionals to anticipate the risk of crime for its citizens. They help the police and investigating officers to prevent any predictive crimes from occuring and help to ensure an overall safety of the citizens of a nation. Hence, through this project we aim to develop a system that integrates and keeps record of the crime data, register complaints and provide citizens with accurately modelled crime data of a state.


With the combination of a well designed DataBase System, a user friendly interface and data modelling techniques, we aim to provide citizens with the accurate data of a nationâ€™s crime, while also providing the police and investigating officers with a platform to maintain and access criminal data and legal data associated with a case for conducting high level crime investigations.This platform serves as a tool for the government to properly document, update and access criminal data while also utilising this data to provide statistics and advisories to its citizens. Hence, this platform will help monitor crime data 24*7.
